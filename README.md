# Medical-Students-Data-Task
Data analysis 3rd Cohort with Promise Chinonso continues to advance as we take on new task with another dataset this time. This is in a bid to keep practicing and expanding our knowledge on Excel. See this task on dataset of Medical Students assigned to us after our 5th Excel/Spreadsheet class.
