# Medical-Students-Data-Task
Data analysis 3rd Cohort with Promise Chinonso continues to advance as we take on new task with another dataset this time. This is in a bid to keep practicing and expanding our knowledge on Excel. See this task on dataset of Medical Students assigned to us after our 5th Excel/Spreadsheet class.
# Introduction
As a follow up on using basic Excel formulas and functions, it is thought that one way to make sense of a given data is by summarizing them using pivot tables and making visualizations using pivot charts such that it can easily be understood by anyone not working with the data, such as the stakeholders, managers, etc.
# Task Activity
Create the following pivot tables showing the following,
#
• Average values of the following for males and females; Age, BMI, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol. 
#
• The average weight and height of each gender in 2 decimal places.
#
• Number of students with different blood groups.
#
• Number of students who smoke and those who don't
#
• Number of students who have diabetes and those who don't
# Data Preparation and Processing
We were assigned to work on a dataset of medical students containing 200,000 rows and 13 columns. The columns had infomation on each student's Id, Age, Gender, Body Mass Index (BMI), Height, Weight, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Types, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol and Yes/No details on their Diabetes and Smoking categories. The dataset had a number of blank cells on each column that needed to be filled up with corresponding data.
# 1
I started by highlighting each text column using ctrl + G, and selecting the option "Blank" to highlight the blank cells and filling it with the needed text data. Next, I calculated the average of each numerical column using the AVERAGE() function as this will be used to fill up blank numerical cells. Then went further to hightlight the blank cells of each numerical column using the keys ctrl + H, selecting the Paste Special option and entering the calculated average into the blank cells of each corresponding columns. In order to ascertain that I had no more blank cells, I selected my column headers and applied filter on each column, then, I checked all the columns one after the other and found no blanks in any column.
# 2
It is imperative to always get rid of duplicates when working with data so as to avoid analytical errors and thus, I selected the entire dataset by clicking ctrl + shift + forward and downward arrow keys, then clicked "Remove Duplicates". This reduced my data from 200,000 to 184998 rows. After this, it was time to create pivot tables. Pivot tables are mainly used to summarise data. This gives quick information on what insight can be drawn from the data. The following shows a picture of the workings from all the steps explained above

After preparing and processing the data, I opened up another worksheet and titled it "Pivot Tables". Furthermore, I created the first pivot table by going back to the dataset worksheet and clicking on any cell, then selecting the "Insert" menu and then Pivot Tables. This brought up a panel which allows me to select the Pivot Table worksheet and position for the pivot table. Same action was taken for the remaining pivot tables to be created.
# Pivot Tables Created
The picture samples below contains all the pivot tables of the above task actvities listed.

# Data Visualization
A data visualization class came after we were taught how to create pivot tables in data analysis. Following this, we were tasked with plotting pivot charts for the pivot tables done in the previous task, excluding that of the first task activity. Pivot charts are graphical diagrams that are used to summarize data. To create a pivot chart from a pivot table, tap on any cell in the pivot table and click "insert" then, "Pivot Chart". This brings up a number of chart types that can be used and by best practices being taught, I selected the most suitable chart type for each data to be represented. The following figures show the pivot charts with accompanying notes to show the insights drawn from the data.

# Conclusion
Data alone conveys no information until it is analysed. Being able to work with data to summarize and obtain useful information with it is very crucial to making guided business decisions. I will love to try my hands on more data to strengthen my skills with this added knowledge.
